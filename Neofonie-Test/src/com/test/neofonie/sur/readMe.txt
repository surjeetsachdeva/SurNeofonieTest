1. The code can be easily compiled and run using java 6
2. There are 3 java files:
  a. PrintNumbersSimpleImpl.java -- this is the solution for the first version of the assignment
  b. PrintNumbersInRangeFromUserInput -- this is the solution for the second version of the assignment
  c. PrintNumbersFromUserInputAndWriteToFile -- this is the solution for the third version of the assignment
3. The code can be compiled by first downloading all the files locally and going to the path ~/com/test/neofonie/sur
and using the following command: javac *.java, this will contain all the necessary class files.
4. To run, we must go back to the start of package hierarchy and then using the following command:
  java com.test.neofonie.sur.{name of class without the .java extension}
5. Alternatively, the files can easily be imported to an eclipse project and run by Eclipse Run As command, by right clicking
on the requisite java file.
